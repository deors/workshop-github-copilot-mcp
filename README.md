# workshop-github-copilot-mcp
Workshop about GitHub Copilot and MCP Servers: integrating MCP Servers in Visual Studio Code with the help of GitHub Copilot and create your own MCP Servers to provision development platform resources in your own way.

## Introduction and general instructions

The workshop is structured around several examples of growing complexity. To support the learning process, and to simplify the deployment & execution of the several MCP servers, the solution to every workshop scenario will be available in a different branch.

The recommended approach is to follow the instructions in this ```README.md``` file, but rely on the solutions available in those branches in case of doubts or when stuck in a given step.
